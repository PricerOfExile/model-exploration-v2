Model Exploration
=================

This is a Jupyter notebook based repository where the different versions of the data are analysed to test the viability of the project
and where the architecture of the nerual network is build.

There is a bunch a code duplication. This is intended to display the though process that lead to the final and v3 version of the data analysis and model.

Just working on one version and making it evolved in a standard git way would hide the different struggles and decisions that lead to the final version.
